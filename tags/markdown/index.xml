      <description>QuickLook is a simple but powerful feature of macOS that helps to preview the content of a file or folder in Finder without using any particular apps. This feature is very handy when we only want to have brief glance on a certain file or quickly examine its parts instead of opening a full-fledged app for that particular file.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a blazingly fast static site generator based on Go. My first experience with Hugo was truly pleasant. I appreciate the separation of contents, presentations, and site generation logics in Hugo that leads to less effort for maintenance or switching themes.</description>
