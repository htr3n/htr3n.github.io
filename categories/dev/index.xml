      <description>One of my past projects relied heavily on XML based configurations and JSP technologies dated back to Spring Framework 3.x. It is still working fine after upgrading to Spring 5 and corresponding dependent libraries such as Hibernate 5, HikariCP 3 and Apache CXF 3.</description>

      <description>I started using Spring framework few years back in 2009 to develop demo systems for some EU projects. These projects featured a number of Web services some of which share back-end databases and some other talk to external services or WS-BPEL business processes.</description>

      <title>Spring Boot properties issues with trailing whitespaces</title>
      <link>https://htr3n.github.io/2018/11/spring-boot-trailing-whitespaces/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://htr3n.github.io/2018/11/spring-boot-trailing-whitespaces/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR:Spring Boot does not trim off the trailing whitespaces in *.properties that in turn might lead to some unexpected errors. As the Spring development team decides to not fix this issue, we can configure code editors to avoid some similar problems.</description>

      <description>Spring is a popular heavy-weight framework for developing Java/Groovy based applications. Its rich libraries and software stack can cover from front-end to back-end development. In 2009 I used Spring Framework 3 to develop web services and MVC + Hibernate portal for a fictious loan approval process.</description>

      <title>Handy macOS QuickLook configurations</title>

      <description>QuickLook is a simple but powerful feature of macOS that helps to preview the content of a file or folder in Finder without using any particular apps. This feature is very handy when we only want to have brief glance on a certain file or quickly examine its parts instead of opening a full-fledged app for that particular file.</description>

      <description>Z shell (Zsh) has been my shell of choice in both Linux and macOS. I used to install oh-my-zsh or the claimed-to-be-faster Prezto or Zim to leverage some of their cool libraries.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a blazingly fast static site generator based on Go. My first experience with Hugo was truly pleasant. I appreciate the separation of contents, presentations, and site generation logics in Hugo that leads to less effort for maintenance or switching themes.</description>

      <description>I have experienced a number of different Mac systems, ranging from the old white MacBook 2006 to iMac and MacMini 2010 and lately MacBook Pro 13&amp;quot; and 15&amp;quot;. From time to time, Time Machine has become extremely handy for transferring my data from the old to the new machine.</description>

      <description>I have used Apache CXF 2.2 to develop Web services for some R&amp;amp;D projects that I took part in. At that time, it was a choice between Apache Axis/Axis2 and CXF (formerly Codehaus XFire project).</description>

      <description>Gentelella is a very nice and gently-looking Bootstrap based admin theme developed by Aigars Silkalns (aka puikinsh). It can be integrated into several Web application frameworks. This post is one of my development exercises in which Gentelella is used to decorate a Laravel 5 based Web application.</description>

      <description>Node.js is an increasingly popular and widely used JavaScript runtime nowadays. One of the important aspects of Node.js is to manage the dependencies among software artefacts. Better dependency management would advocate modularisation and decoupling of software components.</description>

      <description>Webpack is a static module bundler for Web applications. It analyses and processes the input application and generates output bundles.&#xA;The design of Webpack architecture is highly modularised and extendable. In this post, I share here some notes on major aspects of Webpack since I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning it.</description>

      <description>To commence my journey in software development, I have looked for a Web framework to build my personal blog. I have started writing blog posts mainly using (Multi)Markdown and plan to migrate other posts to Markdown too.</description>

      <description>Together, Apache HTTP server, PHP, and MySQL form a powerful and popular combination for Web development. MacOS are often shipped with pre-installed versions of Apache HTTP server and PHP but these are often outdated and merely customised for macOS.</description>
